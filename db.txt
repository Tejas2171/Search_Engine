Full Form of WHO ? World Health Organization
Who is Narendra Modi ? Narendra Damodardas Modi ( born  17 September  1950)[a] is an Indian politician serving as the  4th and current prime minister of India since 20 4. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 200  to 20 4 and is the Member of Parliament from Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiy Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriy Swaymsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister to have been born after India's independence in  947 and the second prime minister not belonging to the Indian National Congress to have won two consecutive majorities in the Lok Sabha, or the lower house of India's parliament. He is also the longest serving prime minister from a non-Congress party. 
What are data Structures ? The data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory. There are many ways of organizing the data in the memory as we have already seen one of the data structures, i.e., array in C language. Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially, i.e., one after another. In other words, we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This organization of data is done with the help of an array of data structures. 
What is DBMS ? A database management system (or DBMS) is essentially nothing more than a computerized data-keeping system. Users of the system are given facilities to perform several kinds of operations on such a system for either manipulation of the data in the database or the management of the database structure itself. Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are categorized according to their data structures or types.
Why is Mental Health important ? Maintaining a positive mental health and treating any mental health conditions  is crucial to stabilizing constructive behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. Focusing on mental health care can increase productivity, enhance our self-image, and improve relationships. mental health isn’t just something we can deal with once and then get over. It’s important in every stage of our life. From infancy all the way into adulthood — mental health is something we need to be cognizant of and handle with care.
Splay Trees ? A splay tree is a self-balancing tree, but AVL and Red-Black trees are also self-balancing trees then. What makes the splay tree unique two trees. It has one extra property that makes it unique is splaying. A splay tree contains the same operations as a Binary search tree, i.e., Insertion, deletion and searching, but it also contains one more operation, i.e., splaying. So. all the operations in the splay tree are followed by splaying.
coep ? College of Engineering Pune (COEP), is an autonomous institute of the Government of Maharashtra,[2] situated in Pune, Maharashtra, India. Established in  854 it is the 2nd oldest engineering college in India, after IIT Roorkee ( 847).[3][4][5] The students and alumni of College of Engineering, Pune are colloquially referred to as COEPians.[6] It was the first technical institution in India to offer mechanical engineering.

Which animal is totally extinct from India ? Indian Cheetah, pink-headed duck, northern Sumatran rhinoceros, and Sunderban dwarf rhinoceros.
What is database ? A Database is a logical, consistent and organized collection of data that it can easily be accessed, managed and updated. Databases, also known as electronic databases are structured to provide the facility of creation, insertion, updating of the data efficiently and are stored in the form of a file or set of files, on the magnetic disk, tapes and another sort of secondary devices. Database mostly consists of the objects (tables), and tables include of the records and fields. Fields are the basic units of data storage, which contain the information about a particular aspect or attribute of the entity described by the database. DBMS is used for extraction of data from the database in the form of the queries.
What is a database system ? The collection of database and DBMS software together is known as a database system. Through the database system, we can perform many activities such as-The data can be stored in the database with ease, and there are no issues of data redundancy and data inconsistency.The data will be extracted from the database using DBMS software whenever required. So, the combination of database and DBMS software enables one to store, retrieve and access data with considerate accuracy and security.
What is a checkpoint in DBMS ? The Checkpoint is a type of mechanism where all the previous logs are removed from the system and permanently stored in the storage disk.There are two ways which can help the DBMS in recovering and maintaining the ACID properties, and they are- maintaining the log of each transaction and maintaining shadow pages. So, when it comes to log based recovery system, checkpoints come into existence. Checkpoints are those points to which the database engine can recover after a crash as a specified minimal point from where the transaction log record can be used to recover all the committed data up to the point of the crash.
When does checkpoint occur in DBMS ? A checkpoint is like a snapshot of the DBMS state. Using checkpoints, the DBMS can reduce the amount of work to be done during a restart in the event of subsequent crashes. Checkpoints are used for the recovery of the database after the system crash. Checkpoints are used in the log-based recovery system. When due to a system crash we need to restart the system then at that point we use checkpoints. So that, we don't have to perform the transactions from the very starting.
What do you mean by transparent DBMS ? The transparent DBMS is a type of DBMS which keeps its physical structure hidden from users. Physical structure or physical storage structure implies to the memory manager of the DBMS, and it describes how the data stored on disk.
What are the unary operations in Relational Algebra ? PROJECTION and SELECTION are the unary operations in relational algebra. Unary operations are those operations which use single operands. Unary operations are SELECTION, PROJECTION, and RENAME.As in SELECTION relational operators are used for example - =,<=,>=, etc.
What is RDBMS ? RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management Systems. It is used to maintain the data records and indices in tables. RDBMS is the form of DBMS which uses the structure to identify and access data concerning the other piece of data in the database. RDBMS is the system that enables you to perform different operations such as- update, insert, delete, manipulate and administer a relational database with minimal difficulties. Most of the time RDBMS use SQL language because it is easily understandable and is used for often.
How many types of database languages are there ? Data Definition Language (DDL) e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME, etc. All these commands are used for updating the data that?s why they are known as Data Definition Language.Data Manipulation Language (DML) e.g., SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, etc. These commands are used for the manipulation of already updated data that's why they are the part of Data Manipulation Language.DATA Control Language (DCL) e.g., GRANT and REVOKE. These commands are used for giving and removing the user access on the database. So, they are the part of Data Control Language.Transaction Control Language (TCL) e.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT. These are the commands used for managing transactions in the database. TCL is used for managing the changes made by DML.
What is a degree of Relation ? The degree of relation is a number of attribute of its relation schema. A degree of relation is also known as Cardinality it is defined as the number of occurrence of one entity which is connected to the number of occurrence of other entity. There are three degree of relation they are one-to-one( : ), one-to-many( :M), many-to-one(M:M).
What is data abstraction in DBMS ? Data abstraction in DBMS is a process of hiding irrelevant details from users. Because database systems are made of complex data structures so, it makes accessible the user interaction with the database.For example: We know that most of the users prefer those systems which have a simple GUI that means no complex processing. So, to keep the user tuned and for making the access to the data easy, it is necessary to do data abstraction. In addition to it, data abstraction divides the system in different layers to make the work specified and well defined.
What is DDL ? Data Definition Language (DDL) is a standard for commands which defines the different structures in a database. Most commonly DDL statements are CREATE, ALTER, and DROP. These commands are used for updating data into the database.
Explain the functionality of DML Compiler ? The DML Compiler translates DML statements in a query language that the query evaluation engine can understand. DML Compiler is required because the DML is the family of syntax element which is very similar to the other programming language which requires compilation. So, it is essential to compile the code in the language which query evaluation engine can understand and then work on those queries with proper output.
What is Relational Algebra ? Relational Algebra is a Procedural Query Language which contains a set of operations that take one or two relations as input and produce a new relationship. Relational algebra is the basic set of operations for the relational model. The decisive point of relational algebra is that it is similar to the algebra which operates on the number.
What is Relational Calculus ? Relational Calculus is a Non-procedural Query Language which uses mathematical predicate calculus instead of algebra. Relational calculus doesn't work on mathematics fundamentals such as algebra, differential, integration, etc. That's why it is also known as predicate calculus.
What do you understand by query optimization ? The term query optimization specifies an efficient execution plan for evaluating a query that has the least estimated cost. The concept of query optimization came into the frame when there were a number of methods, and algorithms existed for the same task then the question arose that which one is more efficient and the process of determining the efficient way is known as query optimization.
What is normalization ? Normalization is a process of analysing the given relation schemas according to their functional dependencies. It is used to minimize redundancy and also used to minimize insertion, deletion and update distractions. Normalization is considered as an essential process as it is used to avoid data redundancy, insertion anomaly, updation anomaly, deletion anomaly.
What is Denormalization ? Denormalization is the process of boosting up database performance and adding of redundant data which helps to get rid of complex data. Denormalization is a part of database optimization technique. This process is used to avoid the use of complex and costly joins. Denormalization doesn't refer to the thought of not to normalize instead of that denormalization takes place after normalization. In this process, firstly the redundancy of the data will be removed using normalization process than through denormalization process we will add redundant data as per the requirement so that we can easily avoid the costly joins.
What is the ERmodel ? E-R model is a short name for the Entity-Relationship model. This model is based on the real world. It contains necessary objects (known as entities) and the relationship among these objects. Here the primary objects are the entity, attribute of that entity, relationship set, an attribute of that relationship set can be mapped in the form of E-R diagram.In E-R diagram, entities are represented by rectangles, relationships are represented by diamonds, attributes are the characteristics of entities and represented by ellipses, and data flow is represented through a straight line.
What is an entity ? The Entity is a set of attributes in a database. An entity can be a real-world object which physically exists in this world. All the entities have their attribute which in the real world considered as the characteristics of the object.For example: In the employee database of a company, the employee, department, and the designation can be considered as the entities. These entities have some characteristics which will be the attributes of the corresponding entity.
What is an Entity type ? An entity type is specified as a collection of entities, having the same attributes. Entity type typically corresponds to one or several related tables in the database. A characteristic or trait which defines or uniquely identifies the entity is called entity type.For example, a student has student_id, department, and course as its characteristics.
What is Weak Entity set ? An entity set that doesn't have sufficient attributes to form a primary key is referred to as a weak entity set. The member of a weak entity set is known as a subordinate entity. Weak entity set does not have a primary key, but we need a mean to differentiate among all those entries in the entity set that depend on one particular strong entity set.
What is an attribute ? An attribute refers to a database component. It is used to describe the property of an entity. An attribute can be defined as the characteristics of the entity. Entities can be uniquely identified using the attributes. Attributes represent the instances in the row of the database.
What do you mean by extension and intension ? Extension: The Extension is the number of tuples present in a table at any instance. It changes as the tuples are created, updated and destroyed. The actual data in the database change quite frequently. So, the data in the database at a particular moment in time is known as extension or database state or snapshot. It is time dependent.Intension: Intension is also known as Data Schema and defined as the description of the database, which is specified during database design and is expected to remain unchanged. The Intension is a constant value that gives the name, structure of tables and the constraints laid on it.
What is Data Independence ? Data independence specifies that "the application is independent of the storage structure and access strategy of data." It makes you able to modify the schema definition at one level without altering the schema definition in the next higher level. It makes you able to modify the schema definition in one level should not affect the schema definition in the next higher level. There are two types of Data Independence: Physical Data Independence: Physical data is the data stored in the database. It is in the bit-format. Modification in physical level should not affect the logical level. For example: If we want to manipulate the data inside any table that should not change the format of the table.Logical Data Independence: Logical data in the data about the database. It basically defines the structure. Such as tables stored in the database. Modification in logical level should not affect the view level.For example: If we need to modify the format of any table, that modification should not affect the data inside it.
What is stored procedure ? A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements that have been created and stored in the database. The stored procedure increases the reusability as here the code or the procedure is stored into the system and used again and again that makes the work easy, takes less time in processing and decreases the complexity of the system. So, if you have a code which you need to use again and again then save that code and call that code whenever it is required.
Explain ACID properties ? ACID properties are some basic rules, which has to be satisfied by every transaction to preserve the integrity. These properties and rules are: ATOMICITY: Atomicity is more generally known as ?all or nothing rule.' Which implies all are considered as one unit, and they either run to completion or not executed at all. CONSISTENCY: This property refers to the uniformity of the data. Consistency implies that the database is consistent before and after the transaction. ISOLATION: This property states that the number of the transaction can be executed concurrently without leading to the inconsistency of the database state. DURABILITY: This property ensures that once the transaction is committed it will be stored in the non-volatile memory and system crash can also not affect it anymore.
Describe the types of keys ? Primary key: The Primary key is an attribute in a table that can uniquely identify each record in a table. It is compulsory for every table. Candidate key: The Candidate key is an attribute or set of an attribute which can uniquely identify a tuple. The Primary key can be selected from these attributes. Super key: The Super key is a set of attributes which can uniquely identify a tuple. Super key is a superset of the candidate key. Foreign key: The Foreign key is a primary key from one table, which has a relationship with another table. It acts as a cross-reference between tables.
How do you communicate with an RDBMS ? You have to use Structured Query Language (SQL) to communicate with the RDBMS. Using queries of SQL, we can give the input to the database and then after processing of the queries database will provide us the required output.
What is Join ? The Join operation is one of the most useful activities in relational algebra. It is most commonly used way to combine information from two or more relations. A Join is always performed on the basis of the same or related column. Most complex queries of SQL involve JOIN command.
What are the three levels of data abstraction ? Following are three levels of data abstraction: Physical level: It is the lowest level of abstraction. It describes how data are stored. Logical level: It is the next higher level of abstraction. It describes what data are stored in the database and what relationship among those data. View level: It is the highest level of data abstraction. It describes only part of the entire database. For example- User interact with the system using the GUI and fill the required details, but the user doesn't have any idea how the data is being used. So, the abstraction level is absolutely high in VIEW LEVEL. Then, the next level is for PROGRAMMERS as in this level the fields and records are visible and the programmer has the knowledge of this layer. So, the level of abstraction here is a little low in VIEW LEVEL. And lastly, physical level in which storage blocks are described.
Which data structure is used to perform recursion ? Stack data structure is used in recursion due to its last in first out nature. Operating system maintains the stack in order to save the iteration variables at each function call
What is a Stack ? Stack is an ordered list in which, insertion and deletion can be performed only at one end that is called the top. It is a recursive data structure having pointer to its top element. The stack is sometimes called as Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) list i.e. the element which is inserted first in the stack will be deleted last from the stack.
What is a postfix expression ? An expression in which operators follow the operands is known as postfix expression. The main benefit of this form is that there is no need to group sub-expressions in parentheses or to consider operator precedence.
What is an array ? Arrays are defined as the collection of similar types of data items stored at contiguous memory locations. It is the simplest data structure in which each data element can be randomly accessed by using its index number.
How to reference all the elements in a one dimension array ? It can be done by using an indexed loop such that the counter runs from 0 to the array size minus one. In this manner, you can reference all the elements in sequence by using the loop counter as the array subscript.
What is a multidimensional array ? The multidimensional array can be defined as the array of arrays in which, the data is stored in tabular form consists of rows and columns. 2D arrays are created to implement a relational database lookalike data structure. It provides ease of holding the bulk of data at once which can be passed to any number of functions wherever required.
What is doubly linked list ? The doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence. In a doubly linked list, a node consists of three parts:  ) node data 2) pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer) 3) pointer to the previous node (previous pointer).
queue ? A queue can be defined as an ordered list which enables insert operations to be performed at one end called REAR and delete operations to be performed at another end called FRONT.
dequeue ? Dequeue (also known as double-ended queue) can be defined as an ordered set of elements in which the insertion and deletion can be performed at both the ends, i.e. front and rear.
Define the tree data structure ? The Tree is a recursive data structure containing the set of one or more data nodes where one node is designated as the root of the tree while the remaining nodes are called as the children of the root. The nodes other than the root node are partitioned into the nonempty sets where each one of them is to be called sub-tree.
What are Binary trees ? A binary Tree is a special type of generic tree in which, each node can have at most two children. Binary tree is generally partitioned into three disjoint subsets, i.e. the root of the node, left sub-tree and Right binary sub-tree.
How can AVL Tree be useful in all the operations as compared to Binary search tree ? AVL tree controls the height of the binary search tree by not letting it be skewed. The time taken for all operations in a binary search tree of height h is O(h). However, it can be extended to O(n) if the BST becomes skewed (i.e. worst case). By limiting this height to log n, AVL tree imposes an upper bound on each operation to be O(log n) where n is the number of nodes.
graph data structure ? A graph G can be defined as an ordered set G(V, E) where V(G) represents the set of vertices and E(G) represents the set of edges which are used to connect these vertices. A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices (Nodes) maintain any complex relationship among them instead of having parent-child relations.
Is Django backend or frontend ? Django is suitable for both the backend and frontend. It's a collection of Python libraries that allow you to develop useful web apps ideal for backend and frontend purposes. Django code reusability Compared to other frameworks, Django offers more code reusability. As Django is a combination of apps, copying those apps from one directory to another with some tweaks to the settings.py file won't need much time to write new applications from scratch.
Why is Cpp faster than Python ? C++ is faster than Python because it is statically typed, which leads to a faster compilation of code. Python is slower than C++, it supports dynamic typing, and it also uses the interpreter, which makes the process of compilation slower.
Why is Web Framework important ? Web frameworks help us achieve structure in our applications, and they give us additional features we can add to them without too much extra work. Frameworks give us a place to start so that we can focus on features rather than configuration details.
Why do we use framework ? The idea of framework is to speed up software development process. Framework helps you by providing reliable functional modules 
Why iot security is important ? Hardware, software and connectivity will all need to be secure for IoT objects to work effectively. Without security for IoT, any connected object, from refrigerators to manufacturing bots, can be hacked. Once hackers gain control, they can usurp the object's functionality and steal the user's digital data.
Why is haptic feedback useful ? It aids in the establishment of a sense of presence. It also establishes an emotional connection, and wellbeing, as well as the exploration and interaction with objects and the provision of 360° sensory feedback.
Why does a computer need ram ? RAM (Random Access Memory) provides fast access and temporary storage for data in computers. RAM sits in-between the processor and permanent data storage, like an HDD/SSD. When a computer is turned on, the processor requests data (such as the operating system) from the HDD/SSD and loads this into RAM.
Why do computers only understand binary ? Computers use binary to store data. Not only because it's a reliable way of storing the data, but computers only understand  s and 0s — binary. A computer's main memory consists of transistors that switch between high and low voltage levels — sometimes 5V, sometimes 0.
Why computational thinking is important ? The biggest benefit of computational thinking is how it enables real-world problem solving. For kids, knowing how to take large problems and break them into simpler steps can help with everything from solving math problems to writing a book report.
Why do we need design thinking ? it brings everyone—beyond designers and developers—into to product design process. This in turn helps entire organizations scale their design processes to create better, human-centered user experiences and disruptive productsz
Is Django a CMS ? No, Django is not CMS (Content Management System). It's just a web framework and programming tool that allows you to build websites.
use of Middlewares in Django ? Middlewares in Django is a lightweight plugin that processes during request and response execution. It performs functions like security, CSRF protection, session, authentication, etc. Django supports various built-in middlewares.
What are signals ? in Django Django includes a "signal dispatcher" to notify decoupled applications when some action takes place in the framework. In a nutshell, signals allow specific senders to inform a suite of receivers that some action has occurred. They are instrumental when we use more pieces of code in the same events.
What are Django Exceptions ? An exception is an abnormal event that leads to program failure. Django uses its exception classes and python exceptions as well to deal with such situations.
Explain Django session ? Django uses the session to keep track of the state between the site and a particular browser. Django supports anonymous sessions. The session framework stores and retrieves data on a per-site-visitor basis. It stores the information on the server side and supports sending and receiving cookies. Cookies store the data of session ID but not the actual data itself.
What are Django cookies ? A cookie is a piece of information stored in the client's browser. To set and fetch cookies, Django provides built-in methods. We use the set_cookie() method for setting a cookie and the get() method for getting the cookie.
Give a brief about Django Admin ? Django Admin is the command-line utility for administrative tasks. It's a preloaded interface to fulfill all web developer's needs and is imported from the "django.contrib packages". Django Admin interface has its user authentication and offers advanced features like authorizing the access, CMS (Content Management System), managing various models, etc.
Give a brief about Django Template ? Django Templates generate dynamic web pages. Using templates, you can show the static data and the data from various databases connected to the app through a context dictionary. You can create any number of templates based on project requirements. Even it's OK to have none of them. Django template engine handles the templating in the Django web framework. Some template syntaxes declare variables, filters, control logic, and comments. Django ships built-in backends for its template system called the Django template language (DTL).
Describe Django ORM ? In Django, the most notable feature is Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), which allows you to interact with app data from various relational databases such as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Django ORM is the abstraction between web application data structure (models) and the database where the data is stored. Without writing any code, you can retrieve, delete, save, and perform other operations over the database. The main advantage of ORMs is rapid development. ORMs make projects more portable. It's easier to change the database with Django ORM.
When to use iterators in Django ? ORM Iterators are containers in Python containing several elements. Every object in the iterator implements two methods that are __init__() and the __next__() methods. In Django, the fair use of an iterator is when you process results that take up a large amount of memory space. For this, you can use the iterator() method, which evaluates the QuerySet and returns the corresponding iterator over the results.
Why is Django called a loosely coupled framework ? Django is known as a loosely coupled framework beca+use of its MTV architecture. Django's architecture is a variant of MVC architecture, and MTV is beneficial because it completely discards server code from the client's machine. Models and Views are present on the client machine, and templates only return to the client. All the architecture components are different from each other. Both frontend and backend developers can work simultaneously on the projects as they won't affect each other when changed.
Is Django too monolithic ? The Django framework is monolithic, which is valid to some extent. As Django's architecture is MTV-based, it requires some rules that developers need to follow to execute the appropriate files at the right time. With Django, you get significant customizations with implementations. Through this, you cannot change file names, variable names, and predefined lists. Django's file structure is a logical workflow. Thus the monolithic behavior of Django helps developers to understand the project efficiently.
What is Ajax ? in Django AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) allows web pages to update asynchronously to and from the server by exchanging data in Django. That means without reloading a complete webpage you can update parts of the web page. It involves a combination of a browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object, HTML DOM, and JavaScript.
What are Django generic views ? Writing views is a heavy task. Django offers an easy way to set Views called Generic Views. They are classes but not functions and stored in "django.views.generic". Generic views act as a shortcut for common usage patterns. They take some common idioms and patterns in view development and abstract them to write common views of data without repeating yourself quickly.
Explain Django Architecture ? Django follows the MVT (Model View Template) pattern which is based on the Model View Controller architecture. It’s slightly different from the MVC pattern as it maintains its own conventions, so, the controller is handled by the framework itself. The template is a presentation layer. It is an HTML file mixed with Django Template Language (DTL). The developer provides the model, the view, and the template then maps it to a URL, and finally, Django serves it to the user.
What are views in Django ? A view function, or “view” for short, is simply a Python function that takes a web request and returns a web response. This response can be HTML contents of a web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, or an image, etc. 
Define static files and explain their uses ? Websites generally need to serve additional files such as images. Javascript or CSS. In Django, these files are referred to as “static files”, Apart from that Django provides django.contrib.staticfiles to manage these static files
What are Django URLs ? URLs are one of the most important parts of a web application and Django provides you with an elegant way to design your own custom URLs with help of its module known as URLconf (URL Configuration). The basic functionality of this python module is to You can design your own URLs in Django in the way you like and then map them to the python function (View function). These URLs can be static as well as dynamic. These URLs as present in the urls.py where they are matched with the equivalent view function. 
What are Django Signals ? Whenever there is a modification in a model, we may need to trigger some actions. Django provides an elegant way to handle these in the form of signals. The signals are the utilities that allow us to associate events with actions. We can implement these by developing a function that will run when a signal calls it.
Explain the caching strategies in Django ? Caching refers to the technique of storing the output results when they are processed initially so that next time when the same results are fetched again, instead of processing again those already stored results can be used, which leads to faster accessing as well us less resource utilization. Django provides us with a robust cache system that is able to store dynamic web pages so that these pages don’t need to be evaluated again for each request. 
What databases are supported by Django ? PostgreSQL and MySQL, SQLite and Oracle. Apart from these, Django also supports databases such as ODBC, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, SAP SQL Anywhere, and Firebird using third-party packages. Note: Officially Django doesn’t support any no-SQL databases.
use of a session framework ? Using the session framework, you can easily store and retrieve arbitrary data based on the pre-site-visitors. It stores data on the server-side and takes care of the process of sending and receiving cookies. These cookies just consist of a session ID, not the actual data itself unless you explicitly use a cookie-based backend
What is context in the Django ? Context is a dictionary mapping template variable name given to Python objects in Django. This is the general name, but you can give any other name of your choice if you want
significance of the settings file ? As the name suggests this file stores the configurations or settings of our Django project, like database configuration, backend engines, middlewares, installed applications, main URL configurations, static file addresses, templating engines, main URL configurations, security keys, allowed hosts, and much more
What is mixin ? Mixin is a type of multiple inheritances wherein you can combine behaviors and attributes of more than one parent class. It provides us with an excellent way to reuse code from multiple classes. One drawback of using these mixins is that it becomes difficult to analyze what a class is doing and which methods to override in case of its code being too scattered between multiple classes.
Django Field Class ? 'Field' refers to an abstract class that represents a column in the database table. The Field class is just a subclass of RegisterLookupMixin. In Django, these fields are used to create database tables (db_types()) which are used to map Python types to the database using get_prep_value() and the other way round using from_db_value() method. Therefore, fields are fundamental pieces in different Django APIs such as models and querysets.
Why is permanent redirection not a good option ? Permanent redirection is used only when you don’t want to lead visitors to the old URLs. The response of the permanent redirections is cached by the browser so when you try to redirect to something else it will cause issues. Since this is a browser-side operation if your user wants to move to a new page it will load the same page.
Difference between Django One To OneField and ForeignKeyField ? Both of them are of the most common types of fields used in Django. The only difference between these two is that ForeignKey field consists of on_delete option along with a model’s class because it’s used for many-to-one relationships while on the other hand, the OneToOneField, only carries out a one-to-one relationship and requires only the model’s class
ways to customize the functionality of the Django admin interface ? There are multiple ways to customize the functionality of the Django admin interface. You can piggyback on top of an add/change form that’s automatically generated by Django, you can add JavaScript modules using the js parameter. This parameter is basically a list of URLs that point to the JavaScript modules that are to be included in your project within a <script> tag. You can also write views for the admin if you want.
Django exceptions ? In addition to the standard Python exceptions, Django raises of its own exceptions.List of the exceptions by Django
Django ? Django is a web development framework that was developed in a fast-paced newsroom. It is a free and open-source framework that was  named after Django Reinhardt who was a jazz guitarist from the  930s. Django is maintained by a non-profit organization called the Django Software Foundation. The main goal of Django is to enable Web Development quickly and with ease.
Name some companies that make use of Django ? Some of the companies that make use of Django are Instagram, DISCUS, Mozilla Firefox, YouTube, Pinterest, Reddit, etc.
Models ? Models are a single and definitive source for information about your data. It consists of all the essential fields and behaviors of the data you have stored. Often, each model will map to a single specific database table.
views ? Django views serve the purpose of encapsulation. They encapsulate the logic liable for processing a user’s request and for returning the response back to the user. Views in Django either return an HttpResponse or raise an exception such as Http404. HttpResponse contains the objects that consist of the content that is to be rendered to the user. Views can also be used to perform tasks such as read records from the database, delegate to the templates, generate a PDF file, etc.
templates ? Django’s template layer renders the information to be presented to the user in a designer-friendly format. Using templates, you can generate HTML dynamically. The HTML consists of both static as well as dynamic parts of the content. You can have any number of templates depending on the requirement of your project. It is also fine to have none of them.
static files ? Static files in Django are those files that serve the purpose of additional files such as the CSS, images or JavaScript files. These files are managed by django.contrib.staticfiles. These files are created within the project app directory by creating a subdirectory named as static.
signals in django ? Django consists of a signal dispatcher that helps allow decoupled applications to get notified when actions occur elsewhere in the framework. Django provides a set of built-in signals that basically allow senders to notify a set of receivers when some action is executed.
Django FieldClass ? ‘Field’ is basically an abstract class that actually represents a column in the database table. The Field class, is in turn, a subclass of  RegisterLookupMixin. In Django, these fields are used to create database tables (db_type()) which are used to map Python types to the database using get_prep_value() and vice versa using from_db_value() method. Therefore, fields are fundamental pieces in different Django APIs such as models and querysets.
sessions in django ? Sessions are fully supported in Django. Using the session framework, you can easily store and retrieve arbitrary data based on the per-site-visitors. This framework basically stores data on the server-side and takes care of sending and receiving cookies. These cookies consist of a session ID but not the actual data itself unless you explicitly use a cookie-based backend.
context in django ? Context in Django is a dictionary mapping template variable name given to Python objects. This is the conventional name, but you can give any other name of your choice if you wish to do it.
When can you use iterators in Django ? ORM Iterators in Python are basically containers that consist of a countable number of elements. Any object that is an iterator implements two methods which are, the __init__() and the __next__()  methods. When you are making use of iterators in Django, the best situation to do it is when you have to process results that will require a large amount of memory space. To do this, you can make use of the iterator() method which basically evaluates a QuerySet and returns the corresponding iterator over the results.
Explain the caching strategies of Django ? Caching basically means to save the output of an expensive calculation in order to avoid performing the same calculation again. Django provides a robust cache system which in turn helps you save dynamic web pages so that they don’t have to be evaluated over and over again for each request.
Explain the use of Middlewares in Django ? You may come across numerous Django Interview Questions, where you will find this question. Middleware is a framework that is light and low-level plugin system for altering Django’s input and output globally. It is basically a framework of hooks into the request/ response processing of Django. Each component in middleware has some particular task. For example, the AuthenticationMiddleware is used to associate users with requests using sessions. Django provides many other middlewares such as cache middleware to enable site-wide cache, common middleware that performs many tasks such as forbidding access to user agents, URL rewriting, etc, GZip middleware which is used to compress the content for browsers, etc.
Why does a computer need output devices ? An output device allows data to be transmitted by the computer in a human-friendly form, for example, sound being played through a speaker. Monitor - The main output device of a computer. It forms images by converting electrical energy into light in the form of tiny dots on the screen called pixels.
why does a computer need language processor ? high-level languages make it easier to instruct a computer what to do. However, because computers only comprehend machine code (in the form of  s and 0s), humans can't speak with them properly without some type of translator. It is for this reason that language processors exist.
why is tourism considered as a trade Foreign ? tourist's arrival in the country contributing to foreign exchange. (ii) Many people are directly engaged in the tourism industry. (iii) Tourism provides support to local handicrafts
significance of manage file in Django ? The manage.py file is automatically generated whenever you create a project. This is basically a command-line utility that helps you to interact with your Django project in various ways. It does the same things as django-admin but along with that, it also sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable in order to point to your project’s settings. Usually, it is better to make use of manage.py rather than the django-admin in case you are working on a single project.
Explain the use of migrate command in Django ? In Django, migrations are used to propagate changes made to the models. The migrate command is basically used to apply or unapply migrations changes made to the models. This command basically synchronizes the current set of models and migrations with the database state. You can use this command with or without parameters. In case you do not specify any parameter, all apps will have all their migrations running.
Explain how a request is processed in Django ? 1) Django first determines which root URLconf or URL configuration module is to be used 2) Then, that particular Python module is loaded and then Django looks for the variable urlpatterns 3) These URL patterns are then run by Django, and it stops at the first match of the requested URL 4) Once that is done, the Django then imports and calls the given view 5) In case none of the URLs match the requested URL, Django invokes an error-handling view
How did Django come into existence ? Django basically grew from a very practical need. World Online developers namely Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison started using Python to develop its websites. As they went on building intensive, richly interactive sites, they began to pull out a generic Web development framework that allowed them to build Web applications more and more quickly. In summer 2005, World Online decided to open-source the resulting software, which is, Django.
Rtgs And Neft ? RTGS: Real Time Gross Settlement. NEFT: National Electronic Fund Transfer. These two are the two methods through which funds can be transferred from one bank to another bank.
cost Of Debt ? When any company borrows funds, from a financial institution (bank) or other resources the interest paid on that amount is known as ‘cost of debt’.
Types Of Accounts ? In Banks The main purpose of SB a/c is to encourage small savings from the public. Interest paid on SB a/c is 3 percent. Any individual can open SB a/c. An Indian residing at abroad can open a NRI a/c. NRI represents non-resident Indians.
prime Rate ? Basically, ‘prime rate’ is the rate of interest that is decided by nations (U.S.A) largest banks for their preferred customers, having a good credit score. Much ‘variable’ interest depends on the ‘prime rates’. For example, the ‘APR’ (Annual Percentage Rate) on a credit card is  0% plus prime rate, and if the prime rate is 3%, the current ‘APR’ on that credit card would be  3%.
Industrial Banks ? The main purpose of industrial banks is to provide big loans to large scale industries. Examples: IDBI bank, Industrial bank of India etc.
Treasury Stock Method ? The treasury stock method is used to calculate the net increase in shares outstanding if in-the-money options and warrants were to be exercised.
Why Should A Company Prefer Equity Finance To Debt ? Finance Equity financing is less risky (you won’t have to pay it back). You’ll have more cash on hand. You won’t have to channel profits into loan repayment. Your equity investors will have a longer term view. Your company will have more credibility. And you might get to tap your investors’ network to help you develop the business.
Why is Java Platform Independent ? Java is platform-independent because it uses a virtual machine. The Java programming language and all APIs are compiled into bytecodes. Bytecodes are effectively platform-independent.
Accretion And Dilution ? Accretion is asset growth through addition or expansion. Accretion can occur through a company’s internal development or by way of mergers and acquisitions. Dilution is a reduction in earnings per share of stock that occurs when additional shares are issued or the stock changes into convertible securities.
Why Python is best for Machine Learning ? The Python library provides base-level items, so developers do not have to write code from scratch every time. Machine learning requires continuous data processing, and Python libraries allow you to access, process, and transform your data.
Why Data Science is important ? The importance of data science is based on the ability to take existing data that is not necessarily useful on its own and combine it with other data points to generate insights an organization can use to learn more about its customers and audience.
Why data should be preprocessed ? Data preprocessing is a required first step before any machine learning machinery can be applied, because the algorithms learn from the data and the learning outcome for problem solving heavily depends on the proper data needed to solve a particular problem – which are called features.
Define Capm ? CAPM is the capital asset pricing model, and it is a model designed to find the expected return on an investment and therefore the appropriate discount rate for a company’s cash flows. It provides the required rate of return given the riskiness of the asset.

Inflation And Deflation ? Inflation: is the increase in the price of goods and services due to more demand and less supply. In inflation, there is more liquidity in market which has to be controlled to reduce the purchasing power of customers. Deflation: is the decrease in prices of goods and services due to more supply and very less demand. In deflation, there is lack of liquidity in market which results in very weak purchasing power of people.
Difference Between Fii And Fdi ? FDI or foreign direct investment is an investment that a parent company makes in a foreign country. FII or Foreign Institutional Investor is an investment made by an investor in the markets of a foreign nation. FII can enter the stock market easily and also withdraw from it easily. But FDI cannot enter and exit that easily as FDI only targets a specific sector.

It was introduced under the Section 35 A of banking regulation act,  949 by RBI with effect from  995 which was later amended and became the banking ombudsman scheme, 2006.
Brown Label Atm ? It refers to the ATMs where investment, installation and maintenance is by a private operator but the license and branding is by a commercial bank.
why is ca language known as middle level language ? C is called middle-level language because it actually binds the gap between a machine level language and high-level languages. A user can use c language to do System Programming (for writing operating systems) as well as Application Programming (for generating menu driven customer billing systems)
why multiplexer is called data selector ? In digital electronics, multiplexers are also known as data selectors because they can “select” each input line, are constructed from individual Analogue Switches encased in a single IC package as opposed to the “mechanical” type selectors such as normal conventional switches and relays.
why demultiplexer? called? a? dat?a distributor ? A demultiplexer sends a single input to multiple outputs, depending on the select lines. For one input, the demultiplexer gives several outputs. That is why it is called a data distributor.
White Label Atm ? It refers to ATMs owned by corporate or private operators seeking to earn a commission by banks for transactions performed by their customers.
Term Repo ? Under term repo, RBI lends to banks through auction of funds. The minimum interest charged has to be above the repo rate and there is no limit for maximum interest rate because auction is made on the rate of interest.
Marginal Standing Facility ? In MSF, banks borrow money from RBI for upto 24 hours. MSF is always  % above the repo rate and banks can draw only upto 25 of their NDTL from RBI.
Statutory Liquidity Ratio ? SLR is the amount of NDTL which a bank needs to maintain in the form of cash, gold or govt. securities before providing credit to its customers. Through SLR, RBI makes sure that bank always have a reserve amount out of their deposits to meet any future contingencies
Cash Reserve Ratio ? CRR is the part of Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) or cash of the bank deposited with the RBI. A higher CRR makes loans expensive as liquidity is controlled by RBI. NDTL is the deposits of the customers with the bank.
Bank Rate ? It is same as repo rate but here the time period is for more than 90 days.
RepoRateAndReverseRepoRate ? Repo rate is the rate :at which banks borrow from RBI during shortage of funds. This is a short term loan provided for upto 90 days by selling securities to RBI and receiving money in lieu of it. Reverse repo rate :is the rate at which banks deposit their excess liquidity with the RBI. In other words, the rate at which RBI borrows from banks by selling securities in order to control excess liquidity in the market is reverse repo rate.
What Is Financial Inclusion ? Financial inclusion is the availability of banking services at a affordable cost in order to include the weaker section of the society in the banking system.
What Is The Difference Between Micro Finance And Micro Credit ? Micro credit is giving a small amount of loan to the customers whereas MicroFinance is a wide term. It includes small loan + training on financial matters. In other words, Microfinance= Microcredit + Financial Literacy.
Priority Sector Credit ? All Indian banks and foreign banks (which have more than 20 branches in India) are required give 40% of their credit to priority sector out of which  8% is for agriculture. In case of Regional Rural Banks, 60% credit is to be given to priority sector.

base Rate ? Base Rate is the minimum rate of interest which a bank has to charge from its customers and a bank can’t sanction loan on a rate below the base rate. Banks may choose any benchmark to decide on the base rate.
Bsbda ? BSBDA stands for Basic Savings Bank deposit account. BSBDA is the new name for “no-frill accounts” under which anyone can open a bank account with even zero balance in it or “zero balance account”. This BSBDA is aimed at providing banking facilities to weaker section of the society and improve financial inclusion.
Cooperative Banks ? The main purpose of cooperative banks is to co-operate small scale industries, and to provide small loans.
Difference Between Cheque And Demand Draft ? Cheque is a negotiable instrument which is paid to the bearer but a demand draft is a negotiable instrument always payble on order.
Term casa Related To Bank ? CASA stands for Current Account Savings Account. The CASA ratio shows how much deposit a bank has in the form of current and saving account deposits in the total deposit. A higher CASA ratio means better operating efficiency of the bank because on current account there is no interest payble whereas on savings account a tiny 3.5% interest is payble by the bank. CASA ratio shows how much of the deposit of the bank comes from the current and savings deposit.
Non Performing Assets Of A Company ? A NPA is an obligation payble to the bank which has not been made or the interest and principal amount has not been paid on the due time. NPA is the loan or credit provided by the bank to its customers which could not be recovered in due time. NPA is also known as “bad debts”.
Nationalized Bank ? Banks which are owned and run by government of India are called as nationalized banks. Example: Canara bank, syndicate bank, Vijay bank, etc.., There are total 20 nationalized banks. State bank of India has got 7 subsidiaries they are State bank of Hyderabad, State bank of Mysore, State bank of Travancore, State bank of Indore, State bank of Saurashtra, State bank of Bikaner, state bank of Jaipur.
Difference Between Nationalized Banks And Private Banks ? A nationalized bank is owned by the govt. of that country and is also known as Public Sector Bank whereas a private sector bank is owned by an independent individual or company.
Nonbanking Financial Company ? A NBFC is a company registered under the companies act,  956 which is involved in the business of loans, shares/stocks, etc. Non-banking financial companies are financial institutions that provide banking services, but do not hold a banking license.
Artificial Intelligence ? Artificial intelligence is computer science technology that emphasizes creating intelligent machine that can mimic human behavior. Here Intelligent machines can be defined as the machine that can behave like a human, think like a human, and also capable of decision making. It is made up of two words, "Artificial" and "Intelligence," which means the "man-made thinking ability."

It is inspired by the human brain cells, called neurons, and works on the concept of neural networks to solve complex real-world problems. It is also known as the deep neural network or deep neural learning.
How is machine learning related to AI ? Machine learning is a subset or subfield of Artificial intelligence. It is a way of achieving AI. As both are the two different concepts and the relation between both can be understood as "AI uses different Machine learning algorithms and concepts to solve the complex problems."
Markovs Decision process ? The solution for a reinforcement learning problem can be achieved using the Markov decision process or MDP. Hence, MDP is used to formalize the RL problem. It can be said as the mathematical approach to solve a reinforcement learning problem. The main aim of this process is to gain maximum positive rewards by choosing the optimum policy.
reward maximization ? Reward maximization term is used in reinforcement learning, and which is a goal of the reinforcement learning agent. In RL, a reward is a positive feedback by taking action for a transition from one state to another. If the agent performs a good action by applying optimal policies, he gets a reward, and if he performs a bad action, one reward is subtracted. The goal of the agent is to maximize these rewards by applying optimal policies, which is termed as reward maximization.
hyperparameter ? In machine learning, hyperparameter is the parameters that determine and control the complete training process. The examples of these parameters are Learning rate, Hidden Layers, Hidden units, Activation functions, etc. These parameters are external from the model. The selection of good hyperparameters makes a better algorithm.
Explain the Hidden Markov model ? Hidden Markov model is a statistical model used for representing the probability distributions over a chain of observations. In the hidden markov model, hidden defines a property that it assumes that the state of a process generated at a particular time is hidden from the observer, and Markov defines that it assumes that the process satisfies the Markov property. The HMM models are mostly used for temporal data.
Give a brief introduction to the Turing test in AI ? Turing test is one of the popular intelligence tests in Artificial intelligence. The Turing test was introduced by Alan Turing in the year  950. It is a test to determine that if a machine can think like a human or not. According to this test, a computer can only be said to be intelligent if it can mimic human responses under some particular conditions.
overfitting ? When the machine learning algorithm tries to capture all the data points, and hence, as a result, captures noise also, then overfitting occurs in the model. Due to this overfitting issue, the algorithm shows the low bias, but the high variance in the output. Overfitting is one of the main issues in machine learning.
NLP ? NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, which is a branch of artificial intelligence. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and manipulate the human language.
use of computer vision in AI ? Computer vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence that is used to train the computers so that they can interpret and obtain information from the visual world such as images. Hence, computer vision uses AI technology to solve complex problems such as image processing, object detections, etc.
Explain the minimax algorithm along with the different terms ? Minimax algorithm is a backtracking algorithm used for decision making in game theory. This algorithm provides the optimal moves for a player by assuming that another player is also playing optimally.
game theory ? Game theory is the logical and scientific study that forms a model of the possible interactions between two or more rational players. Here rational means that each player thinks that others are just as rational and have the same level of knowledge and understanding. In the game theory, players deal with the given set of options in a multi-agent situation, it means the choice of one player affects the choice of the other or opponent players.
Artificial neural network ? Artificial neural networks are the statistical model inspired by the functioning of human brain cells called neurons. These neural networks include various AI technologies such as deep learning and machine learning.
Chatbot ? A chatbot is Artificial intelligence software or agent that can simulate a conversation with humans or users using Natural language processing. The conversation can be achieved through an application, website, or messaging apps. These chatbots are also called as the digital assistants and can interact with humans in the form of text or through voice.
knowledge representation in AI ? Knowledge representation is the part of AI, which is concerned with the thinking of AI agents. It is used to represent the knowledge about the real world to the AI agents so that they can understand and utilize this information for solving the complex problems in AI.
reinforcement learning ? Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning. In this, an agent interacts with its environment by producing actions, and learn with the help of feedback. The feedback is given to the agent in the form of rewards, such as for each good action, he gets a positive reward, and for each bad action, he gets a negative reward. There is no any labeled data or supervision is provided to the agent. In RL, the agent continuously does three things(performing actions, changing state, and getting the feedback) to explore the environment.
tensor flow ? Tensor flow is the open-source library platform developed by the Google Brain team. It is a math library used for several machine learning applications. With the help of tensor flow, we can easily train and deploy the machine learning models in the cloud.

How can AI be used in fraud detection ? The artificial intelligence can be broadly helpful in fraud detection using different machine learning algorithms, such as supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The rule-based algorithms of Machine learning helps to analyze the patterns for any transaction and block the fraudulent transactions.
inference engine ? In artificial intelligence, the inference engine is the part of an intelligent system that derives new information from the knowledge base by applying some logical rules.
fuzzy logic ? Fuzzy logic is a method of reasoning applied to the AI, which resembles human reasoning. Here the word "fuzzy" defines things that are not clear, it means the situations where it is difficult to decide if the state is True or False. It involves all the possibilities that occur between Yes and NO.
Bayesian network ? Bayesian networks are the graphical models that are used to show the probabilistic relationship between a set of variables. It is a directed cycle graph that contains multiple edges, and each edge represents a conditional dependency.
heuristic function ? The heuristic function is used in Informed Search, and it finds the most promising path. It takes the current state of the agent as its input and produces the estimation of how close the agent is from the goal. The heuristic method, however, might not always give the best solution, but it guaranteed to find a good solution in a reasonable time. Heuristic function estimates how close a state is to the goal. It is represented by h(n), and it calculates the cost of an optimal path between the pair of states. The value of the heuristic function is always positive.
prerequisites of being a web developer ? A beginner web developer is expected to have a fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other aspects like jQuery, SQL, and some other scripting languages. An experienced web developer is expected to have all the given aspects and great knowledge of design patterns.
CORA ? Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is defined as the browser mechanism that involves controlled resources access granted outside the given domain. It can enable a web page to access the resource with a different domain. It is a relaxation of some policies associated with browsers implemented on the same origin.
ETag ? An ETag is termed an opaque identifier that is usually allocated by the webserver. It is primarily used within the same version of the resources provided in the URL. ETag is an important part of HTTP and is responsible for reading client requests to notify whether to send the file (HTTP 200) or inform the client through a local copy (HTTP 304).
How to integrate different stylesheets into a website ? It depends on the factor of how the site is laid out. However, for the most efficient performance, one file can be used with styles.css. If you want to change any style, open up the styles.css file, and in the relevant section, you can modify CSS. You can also link your HTML file through the below command.
Define Scope in JavaScript and name different types of Scopes ? The scope is usually defined to felicitate the accessibility of variables and methods(functions) in applications. There are two types of Scopes in JavaScript: Local and Global.
State how HTML differs from XHTML ? HTML usually has three components, i.e., start and end tag, elemental attribute tags, and content in text and graphics. In contrast, XHTML includes a single root element that constitutes only lower case elements whose values assigned should be nested and closed. They also need to round with quotation marks. Therefore, it comes down to a conclusion that XHTML is more expressive than HTML is more framed.
Node Package Manager ? NPM is a package manager for JavaScript. NPM is designed to put modules intact so that nodes when the need can find them. It is designed to maintain and serve conflicts arising in dependencies. It is mostly used to install programs, configure them, publish and develop them using the intact resources in the modules.
Webpack ? Webpack in JavaScript is generally a static module bundler designed to bundle JS files in the browser and check their usage. It dynamically puts various files, assets, images, and fonts in a graph of dependency. It enables you to use the required () method to point to the files and figure out how they will be processed in the final bundle of JavaScript. Initially, a webpack slows down when used initially, but the speed eventually picks when correctly used.
Document Object Model ? DOM is defined as the interface channeling cross-platform programming and is primarily used to represent HTML and XML documents in nodes and objects. In simple words, DOM defines the way of manipulating the logical structure of the documents and how they are accessed. It can enable developers to modify, create, or remove the document structure, content, and style used.
How can you effectively handle type conversion in JavaScript ? Since JavaScript is a weakly typed language, it automatically converts the data to that type to which an operator or statement expects a particular data type to be converted. JavaScript supports automatic type conversion, and it is the only way to handle different types of type conversion techniques for JavaScript developers.
CDN in jQuery ? A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is an interconnection of computer systems globally, and it contains cache files for users to access. It enables users to access the content quite fast by duplicating or caching the content optimally stored on multiple servers and then directing them according to the proximity.
Responsive Web Design ? Responsive web design is generally a concept of creating web pages that can be easily scaled across various resolutions without losing any information or screen tearing. The main concept of responsive web design is to deliver the structure of the web page that can be automatically adjusted across various platforms and devices with an optimal viewing experience.
Why is the selector used in CSS ? The selector in CSS is used in styling with the rule of the inline elements. It is easy to choose and select HTML elements with selector usage based on factors including attributes, ID, and name.
Why are media queries used in CSS ? Media queries in CSS are used to define different media asset queries that are responsive and come in different varieties of shapes and sizes depending upon the viewer's window. The entities may include height, width, viewport, resolution, orientation, etc.
Why do we use DOCTYPE in HTML ? DOCTYPE in HTML denotes the instruction given to a web browser regarding the version of markup language. The web browsers understand the Document Type Definition (DTD) from the HTML document and provide some markup language rules so that the web browser can easily interpret the content correctly.
lazy loading ? Lazy loading is defined as a design pattern used in computer programming to delay the object initialization until a certain required period. Lazy loading is time-constrained since the code gets loaded when the user needs it. For instance, a button on a page directs to a different layout when it is clicked. Hence, there is no need for code loading for the initial layout. Besides, lazy loading contributes to the overall performance of a program if properly utilized.
Event Bubbling ? Event bubbling is defined as the type of event propagation where the target element is first triggered. The triggering causes all the events of the child node to pass them to the parent node. The main reason for doing event bubbling is to get the speed since the code needs to traverse the DOM tree only once.
Closure ? A closure is termed as a sequence of function bundling referencing the enclosing state. It allows you to access the scope of external function from an inner function. Whenever another function renders a function, this is when the concept of closure becomes more relevant. Thus, the rendered function will have access to the variable not in the global scope but can individually access their closure.
Microprocessor ? The microprocessor is a program-controlled device, which reads a set of steps to be executed from memory and executes them.
Why Crystal Is Preferred for A Clock Source ? The main reason to use crystal is high stability, large O, and accurate frequency, which remains constant all the time.
programm Counter ? Program counter holds a location in memory of the next step to be performed or the ‘s locationnext step’s location in a set of steps in case of multistep instruction. In all cases, the counter is increased by one as steps are progressed. Also, the program register keeps the address of the next instruction.
Explain the differences Between the Hlt and Hold ? States When the HLT state is executed, the processor stops functioning; buses go into tri-state. The processor gives no acknowledgment in any form.
Where does CPU Enhanced mode Originate From ? Intel’s 80386 was the first 32-bit processor, so the company had to support 8086 backward. All the modern Intel-based processors run in the enhanced mode, capable of switching between real and protected mode, which is the current mode of operation.
Significancea of Interrupt in Any Microprocessor ? There is an utmost significance of interrupt in any microprocessor especially when it comes to generate signals using external nodes or say peripherals. These external nodes or peripherals are mostly used for performance with the current task with start and stop triggers having another usage it mostly has five interrupts starting from 5.5, 6.5, INTR, 7.5, TRAP, and RST.
Why is Johnson Counter used ? Johnson counter connects the complement of the output of the last shift register to its input and circulates a stream of ones followed by zeros around the ring. For example, in a 4-register counter, the repeating pattern is: 0000,  000,  00,  0,  , 0 , 00 , 000 , so on.
Why is digital marketing important ? Digital marketing is defined by the use of numerous digital tactics and channels to connect with customers where they spend much of their time: online. The best digital marketers have a clear picture of how each digital marketing campaign supports their overarching goals. And depending on the goals of their marketing strategy, marketers can support a larger campaign through the free and paid channels at their disposal.
Why string is immutable in Java ? The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.
